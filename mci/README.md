### Multi-Color Image
#### Task: Create a multi-color image of M81 using observations taken with the Vassar College Class of 1951 Observatory's telescope, and write a report on the process.

Abstract: This report details the multi-color imaging of Messier 81 (M 81), also known as Bode's Galaxy, conducted with the Vassar College Class of 1951 Observatory. 
Utilizing a 32-inch reflecting telescope equipped with research-grade electronic cameras and spectrographs, observations were made in blue, green, red, and yellow filters to produce a comprehensive multi-colored image. 
The data acquisition process, including calibration frames such as flats, darks, and biases, was meticulously documented and executed. 
Challenges encountered during data reduction, including inconsistencies in file organization and filter performance, were addressed, resulting in a final multi-color image. 
Analysis of the final image revealed insights into the brightness distribution and structure of M 81, highlighting the galaxy's spiral arms and central bulge. 
Additionally, calculations based on the apparent and absolute magnitudes of M 81 yielded valuable astrophysical parameters. 
This project not only enhanced observational skills but also provided valuable insights into the properties and behavior of spiral galaxies like M 81.
